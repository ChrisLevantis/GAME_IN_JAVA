# GAME_IN_JAVA
A simple game with letters, implemented in Java.

When you start the game it will apear a Start menu, with two options, START and DELETE, with the player pressed the DELETE button the game will end here. If the player press the START button the main game frame will appear with an array (10x10), and 100 boxes will created with indexes from 1 to 100.
The player can left click in the mouse, and the letter frame will be created, BUT it will appear for a small amount of time (1 sec), the player must see quickly the letters that will appear in this frame and match the same letters with the indexes that they have (in the main game frame). Then he/she can press the sumbit button of the cnotrol panel that will also be created with the main game frame, and see if the answer is right.

The player must find ONLY one pair of each letter (around 100). 
The player has only 20 tries to find all the pairs.

If 
the player find all the pairs the game will restart, a new game frame will created, and a new letters frame will created also the tries will be again 20.

if
the player dont find all the pairs and run out of tries, only the letters frame will restart, with new letters and the tries will be again 20.

NOTE THE COLORS THAT CHANGE IN LETTERS FRAME AND (AND IN THE GAME FRAME AFTER THE RESTART OF THE GAME) ARE THERE JUST TO MAKE MORE CONFUSE THE GAME.
